Code and documentation for the Severe Weather R Shiny App created for Saint Paul Public Schools (SPPS) to use for their Earth Science curriculum. Creation of this app served as Anne Hackman's Applied Practice project and was part of a collaboration with SPPS and the UMN Biostatistics Community Outreach and Engagement Committee (BCOE). Students can use this app to investigate trends in severe weather in the upper Midwest from 2000-2023.
